## 🔐 Security Measures

### 🛡️ Current Security Features

- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting per endpoint
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS policies
- **Security Headers**: Standard security headers implemented
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management
- **Audit Logging**: Security events logged
- **Docker Security**: Non-root container execution

### 🔒 Best Practices

#### For Developers
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security code analysis
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in code
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

#### For Users
- **Strong Secrets**: Use strong, unique secrets for MCP_SECRET_KEY
- **Network Security**: Run behind secure proxy in production
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and Docker images updated
- **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting
- **Backup**: Regular backups of configuration and data

## 🔍 Security Audit

### 📊 Regular Security Measures

- **Monthly**: Dependency vulnerability scans
- **Quarterly**: Security code reviews
- **Annually**: Third-party security audits (planned)

### 🧪 Security Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Security-focused unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Authentication and authorization tests
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation testing

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### 🔐 Lark API Security
- **Token Management**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed
- **Rate Limiting**: Lark API rate limits are respected
- **Data Encryption**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Permission Scope**: Minimal required permissions requested

### 🤖 MCP Protocol Security
- **Input Validation**: All MCP requests validated
- **Tool Restrictions**: Tools have defined input schemas
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses (no information leakage)
- **Session Management**: Stateless design with JWT tokens

### 🔌 n8n Integration Security
- **Webhook Security**: Webhook endpoints properly secured
- **Data Isolation**: Workflow data properly isolated
- **Authentication**: n8n integration requires authentication
- **HTTPS Only**: All integrations use encrypted communications

## 📋 Security Configuration

### 🔧 Recommended Production Configuration

```bash
# Strong authentication
MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=true
MCP_SECRET_KEY=your-super-strong-secret-key-here

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true

# Network security
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
SSL_ENABLED=true
```

### 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Default Secrets**: Never use default or weak secrets
- **Disabled Authentication**: Don't disable authentication in production
- **Open CORS**: Avoid wildcard CORS in production
- **Debug Mode**: Don't run in debug mode in production
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- **Unencrypted Communications**: Always use HTTPS/TLS

## 🔄 Incident Response

### 📋 Response Process

1. **Detection**: Security incident detected
2. **Assessment**: Impact and scope assessment
3. **Containment**: Immediate containment measures
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review

### 🚨 Emergency Contacts
