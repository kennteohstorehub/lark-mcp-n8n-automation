# 🚨 Emergency Android Backup Setup Guide

## 🔥 URGENT: Phone Crashing - Data Backup Required

If your phone is crashing and you need to backup your data before a factory reset, follow these steps:

### 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

#### 1. Enable USB Debugging (Critical)
- Go to **Settings** → **About Phone** → Tap **Build Number** 7 times
- Go back to **Settings** → **Developer Options** → Enable **USB Debugging**
- If your phone keeps crashing, try to do this during a stable moment

#### 2. Install ADB Tools on Your Computer

**Windows:**
```bash
# Download ADB from Android SDK Platform Tools
# Or install via chocolatey:
choco install adb
```

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install android-platform-tools
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install android-tools-adb

# Fedora
sudo dnf install android-tools
```

#### 3. Connect Phone
- Use original USB cable (better connection)
- When prompted, **Allow USB Debugging** on your phone
- If phone crashes during setup, restart and try again

### 🚀 Quick Start - Emergency Backup

1. **Run the backup tool:**
   ```bash
   node android_emergency_backup.js
   ```

2. **The tool will automatically:**
   - Check your device connection
   - Identify critical data (photos, videos, documents, WhatsApp, etc.)
   - Create organized backup folders
   - Save contacts and SMS messages
   - Generate a complete backup report

### 📱 What Gets Backed Up

**🔴 Priority 1 (Most Critical):**
- 📸 Photos from Camera (DCIM/Camera)
- 🎥 Videos from Camera
- 📷 All Pictures folder

**🟡 Priority 2 (Important):**
- 📄 Documents folder
- 📱 WhatsApp data and media
- 🎤 Voice recordings
- 📥 Downloads folder

**🟢 Priority 3 (Nice to Have):**
- 🎵 Music files
- 📱 App backup files (APKs)

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Keep phone connected** throughout the process
- **Don't use phone** during backup to avoid crashes
- **Backup runs in batches** to prevent overwhelming the device
- **Large files (>50MB)** are skipped to save time
- **Most critical data** is backed up first

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Phone not detected:**
- Try different USB cable
- Restart phone and computer
- Check USB debugging is enabled
- Try different USB port

**Phone keeps crashing:**
- Restart phone and try immediately
- Use safe mode if available
- Remove SIM card to reduce load
- Keep phone cool during backup

**Backup fails:**
- Check available disk space on computer
- Try backing up smaller batches
- Focus on most critical data first

### 🎯 After Backup

1. **Verify backup files** are complete
2. **Copy to cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
3. **Test a few files** to ensure they open correctly
4. **Factory reset** your phone
5. **Restore from backup** after reset

### 📊 Storage Analysis

Based on your device analysis, you have:
- **Root partition:** 100% full (causing crashes)
- **Data partition:** 44% full (202GB used, 261GB free)
- **Cache partition:** 7% full

The crashes are likely due to the full root partition. A factory reset will solve this issue.
